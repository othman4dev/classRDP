        <p class="spl">
          All payments made through our website are final. Once a transaction is
          completed, we do not offer refunds. This is because we operate in an
          anonymous environment where cryptocurrency payments are irreversible.
          We cannot trace, reverse, or refund any payments once processed.

          You may cancel your service at any time through your account
          dashboard. However, as per our policy, we do not offer refunds for

          In the unlikely event of a service disruption, we will work diligently

          We strongly advise against initiating chargebacks, as these actions
          violate our terms of service. Any attempt to chargeback a

          loss of service.
